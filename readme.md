Formally a teacher. After six years educating young people in IT & Computing, I needed a new challenge. Having inspired others to code I felt it was time to further shape and build my skills at Makers Academy web development bootcamp.

I am looking to start my new career in an environment with a focus on software craftsmanship and where I can continue to accelerate new skills.
