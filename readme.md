Formally a teacher. After five years educating young people in IT & Computing, I needed a new challenge. Having inspired others to code I felt it was time to further shape and build my skills at Makers Academy web development bootcamp.

I am looking to start my new career in an environment with a focus on software craftsmanship and where I can continue to accelerate these new and creative skills.

## Code Examples
| Project                 | Description             | Technologies            |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| [Phlash](https://github.com/chriscoates/phlash) | Phlash is a photo-messaging iPhone app that encourages spontaneity. | Swift, Xcode, Parse, XCTest.
**Approved by Apple for Beta testing** |
| [Memeories](https://github.com/chriscoates/memeories) | An app for creating Memes integrated with Slack webhooks.   | Ruby on Rails, Javascript, jQuery, Rspec, Capybara, PostgreSQL               |
| [Instagram Clone](https://github.com/chriscoates/instagram-challenge) | A web clone of instagram. Allows users to post and comment on images. | Ruby on Rails, Omniauth, AWS, Capybara, Rspec, PostgreSQL |


## Skills

#### Passionate Learner

- Enthusiastic about dreaming big and a strong believer in a can do attitude. An interest in mobile technology influenced the decision to produce a final project in Swift. The result was Phlash, an iOS app created in a team of four in twelve days. Working with a strongly typed language was a great learning experience and provided a good contrast to Ruby and JavaScript.
- Commitment to working in an Agile environment by participating in daily stand-ups and weekly retros.
- Curious nature with a passion to embrace and learn new technologies in order to deliver user-friendly solutions which provide great experiences for the end user.

#### Clear Communicator

- As a teacher, it was essential to articulate ideas and complex concepts clearly to students. I have carried this skill over into my coding life where feedback from my team and pair partners have noted my ability to talk through what I have done/doing and about to do.
- Can articulate difficult concepts and can work well individually and as part of a team in order bring people onboard with purpose and vision.
