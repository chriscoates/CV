#### Passionate Learner

- First software development job – applying skills and experience form Makers Academy. Fully immersed myself into quickly learning new languages, frameworks and technology. Pair programming to maximise potential. Regular attender of Nottingham Meetups to keep abreast of new tech and opportunity to strengthen my knowledge.
- Curious nature with a passion to embrace and learn new technologies and solutions to provide great experiences for the end user.

#### Determined and Tenacious
- Completing Makers Academy and securing first software development job within four weeks of graduation. Significant contributor to the mobile team. Personal work and learning at home to enrich and bring in new initiatives to the technology stack.
-	Enthusiastic about dreaming big and a strong believer in a can do attitude. An interest in mobile technology influenced the decision to produce a final project in Swift. The result was Phlash, an iOS app created by a team of 4 in 12 days. Working with a strongly typed language was a great learning experience and provided a good contrast to Ruby and JavaScript.
-	I thrive on succeeding as part of a team. Pair programming and group work have at times been intense, but I am confident in my ability to be part of a great team that sets out what it intends to do.

#### Clear Communicator

-	Articulate ideas and complex concepts to members of the team including our distributed team working in Minsk, Hyderabad and Boston Massachusetts. I have carried these skills over into my coding life where feedback from my team and pair partners have noted my ability to present, explain and discuss ideas clearly.
