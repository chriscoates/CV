#### Passionate Learner

- Fully immerse myself into quickly learning new languages, frameworks and technology. Pair programming to maximise potential. Regular attender of Nottingham Meetups to keep abreast of new tech and opportunity to strengthen my knowledge.
- Curious nature with a passion to embrace and learn new technologies and solutions to provide great experiences for the end user.

#### Determined and Tenacious
- I thrive on succeeding as part of a team. Personal work and learning at home in my own time to enrich and bring in new initiatives to the technology stack.
- Enthusiastic about dreaming big and a strong believer in a can do attitude. An interest in mobile technology during my training influenced the decision to produce a project in Swift. The result was Phlash, an iOS app created by a team of four in just twelve days. Working with a strongly typed language was a great learning experience and provided a good contrast to Ruby and JavaScript.

#### Clear Communicator
